What Are Interest Rates for Stretch Loans?

Stretch loans are convenient, but they're meant to be short-term loans, so they come with high interest rates and fees. However, interest rates for stretch loans are significantly lower than at a storefront payday lender. If you belong to a credit union, payday alternative loans (PALs) offer application fees that top out at $20.1 Interest rates on PALS can be up to 28%.

Is a Stretch Loan the Same as a Senior Stretch Loan?

No. They're quite different in that a senior stretch loan is offered primarily to middle-market companies to finance leveraged buyouts.
The Bottom Line

A stretch loan provides money to cover a gap that you may have financially. However, it comes with interest rates and fees, so research other options, such as getting a personal loan from a family member or friend, or tapping into a retirement account that might have a lower interest rate, before committing to a stretch loan.
