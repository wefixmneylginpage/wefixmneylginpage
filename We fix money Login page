Personal loans are a type of closed-end credit, with set monthly payments over a predetermined period (e.g., three, four, or five years). Interest rates on personal loans are expressed as a percentage of the principalâ€”the amount you borrow.

The rate quoted is the nominal annual percentage rate (APR) or the rate applied to your loan each year, including any fees and other costs, but not costs related to compounding or the effect of inflation. Most personal loans actually use the monthly periodic rate, which is arrived at by dividing the APR by 12. When applied to the principal, the APR (or periodic rate) determines the additional amount you will pay to borrow the principal and pay it back over time.
