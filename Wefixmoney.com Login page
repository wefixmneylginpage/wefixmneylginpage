Stretch loans provide convenience to the customer in time of need, but they can be much more expensive than traditional personal loans or working capital facilities. Interest rates are higher, and there are also likely to be application fees. So before applying for a stretch loan, the would-be borrower should make sure that there aren't more economical options available, possibly from that same lender.

Note that a stretch loan shouldnâ€™t be confused with the similar-sounding senior stretch loan. That's a type of business loan that combines senior debt and junior (or subordinated) debt into one package and is most commonly used in leveraged buyouts.
